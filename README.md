# Reinforcement-Learning 

MAST 679H Reinforcement Learning Course - Term Project (Fall 2020)

Pricing American Option

Derivative securities are important financial instruments that allow investors to create better portfolios. Among these are the American Option, whose pricing is a fascinating
application area for reinforcement learning (RL). In this project, I applied the following RL methods: an off-Policy TD Control method known as Watkin's Q-learning, a Double Q-learning method to estimate the optimal action-value function,a fitted Q-Learning approach and a Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) method. The fitted Q-Learning and the LSPI are based in part on the Longstaff-Schwartz Algorithm. The respective performances of these methods will be evaluated on simulated data.

The code was made in R Studio, and each applied method was made from scratch.
